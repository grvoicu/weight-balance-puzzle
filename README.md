# weight-balance-puzzle
Suppose you want to create a set of weights so that any object with an integer weight from 1 to 40 pounds can be balanced on a two-sided scale by placing a certain combination of these weights onto that scale. What is the fewest number of weights you need, and what are their weights?

This programs uses the [CP-SAT](https://developers.google.com/optimization/cp/cp_solver) solver to find all possible solutions with 4 weights.
